#  Roman Numerals Converter

## Background
Roman numerals are essentially a decimal or "base 10" number system, but instead of place value notation (in which 'place-keeping' zeros enable a digit to represent different powers of ten) it uses a set of symbols with fixed values. Tally-like combinations of these fixed symbols correspond to the digits of Arabic numerals. This structure allows for significant flexibility in notation, and many variant forms are attested.

## Purpose
To convert the decimal number system to Roman numerals

The largest number that can be represented in this notation is 3,999 (MMMCMXCIX), but since the largest Roman numeral likely to be required today is MMXX (the current year) there is no practical need for larger Roman numerals. Prior to the introduction of Arabic numerals in the West, ancient and medieval users of the system used various means to write larger numbers

| Symbol | I   | V   | X   | L   | C   | D   | M    |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| Value  | 1   | 5   | 10  | 50  | 100 | 500 | 1000 |

## How
Running `main.go` will prompt for a number between 1 and 3,999 and convert to Roman numerals

## Example
23 would convert to XXIII

457 would convert to CDLVII

2721 would convert to MMDCCXXI
